## Collections of tools
* https://www.geocachingtoolbox.com: this is pretty much a go-to for most cachers. It has many of the most common ciphers, alphabets, conversion tools.
* https://www.dcode.fr/en: Has tons of ciphers and codes. It's a little messier looking of a website, but one feature I enjoy is the "brute force" when you know what cipher you need (or think you do), but not sure the parameters you need. Brute forcing it will run all possibilities.
* https://www.cachesleuth.com: Made for geocahing. Has loads of different ciphers, maps, codes, and number tools.
